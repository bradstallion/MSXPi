Please refer to the projectâ€™s documentation:

The easier way to start is to download a MSXPi SD CARD image for the Raspberry Pi, which can be found under:

https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/releases/download/v1.0.20200822.000/MSXPiv1.0Rev0_SDCard_Image.zip

The login user and password are the default for Raspbian:
user: pi
password: raspberry

Use pwifi command from MSX-DOS to setup the wifi network and key.

To prepare the Raspberry Pi from a vanilla Raspbian image, follow the README.install in the link above.

I recommend to use the MSXPi along with other MSX-DOS device, such as MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD or similar. For the, you need to copy the ".com" commands from MSXPi GitHub project repository to the SD Card.
