MSXPi
=====

MSXPi is a hardware interface and software solution to allow MSX computers to control and user Raspberry Pi resources.
The interface exposes ports that can be read and written by MSX, and in turn will be accessible on the Raspberry Pi.
Many resources are implemented, such as access to network drives, internet, disk images, and the Raspberry Pi itself.

The code, schematics and cpld designs for MSXPi are released in git branches as they achieve an acceptable maturity level. Use one of the "release/version" branches that is more appropriate to your interface.

Note that this is Work In Progress, therefore there are already a few versions released and under tests. None of this work is provided with warranty, and should be used at your own risks even though I never damaged any MSX or Raspberry pi in the 4 years of development of this project.

Quick Start Guide
=================

Please refer to the full documentation under "documents" folder for detailed setup procedure.

There are two main steps to setup MSXPi, once you choose the correct branch for your interface:

1. Setup Rapsberry Pi with the server-side software (Raspberry Pi SD Card)
2. Setup MSX with the client side software (MSX SD Card or disk)


* Step 1: The easier way to setup the Raspberry Pi is to download the SD CARD image from a MSXPi release - latest image for release v0.8.2 and v1.0 can be found under: https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/releases/download/v1.0.1.20200905.001/MSXPiv1.0Rev0_b20200905.001_SDCard_img.zip

The login user and password are the default for Raspbian: 

user: pi
password: raspberry


* Step 2: Copy all MSXPi commands form the /software/target to your MSX-DOS SD card (or disk). Use pwifi command from MSX-DOS to setup the wifi network and key, and MSXPi is fully ready to use.
All software to copy for you MSX SD CARD can be found under https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/releases/tag/v1.0.1.20200905.001/

Jumpers:
A14 - MSX detects MSXPi BIOS and continue to BASIC (MSX-DOS if other IDE interface is connected).
A15 - MSX detects MSXPI BIOS. If user press P, boots from MSXPi-DOS. Otherwise proceeds with MSX boot.

In either jumper setup, the MSXPi BIOS is available to use from BASIC. Type "CALL MSXPIVER" for a list of commands.
