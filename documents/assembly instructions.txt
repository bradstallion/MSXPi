1. Solder LD117A voltage converter
2. Short/solder SMD jumpers CS,CLK,MISO,MOSI,RDY (left & center legs)
3. Solder all resistors
4. Solder CPLD socket, EEPROM, RPI Socket, JTAG connector
5. Solder Capacitor C8 (Electrolitic)
6. (Reset Optional: Not extensively tested & not recommended) Solder Capacitor C9 & momentary push buttons in J5/J6
7. Solder the led and all ceramic capacitors

Notes:

About step 2: These jumpers enable future changes to the communication with RPi using different GPIO pins.

About stop 4: It's recommended to use a socket for the EEPROM, but not absolutely necessary. Using an EEPROM helps in case of issues in the future.

Abut step 6: This reset signal may not work on many MSX Models, and may even damage some models. If you do want a reset in the interface, do some research in the specialised MSX groups about the impact of this circuit in your specific MSX model. I recommend you do not assembly this, and I do not assume any responsibility if you damage your computer.
