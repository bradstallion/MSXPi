; File history :
; 0.8    : Re-worked protocol as protocol-v2:
;          RECVDATABLOCK, SENDDATABLOCK, SECRECVDATA, SECSENDDATA,CHKBUSY
;          Moved to here various routines from msxpi_api.asm
; 0.7    : Replaced CHKPIRDY retries to $FFFF
;          Removed the RESET when PI is not responding. This is now responsability
;           of the calling function, which might opt to do something else.
; 0.6c   : Initial version commited to git
;
;
; Inlude file for other sources in the project
;
; ==================================================================
; BASIC I/O FUNCTIONS STARTS HERE.
; These are the lower level I/O routines available, and must match
; the I/O functions implemented in the CPLD.
; Other than using these functions you will have to create your
; own commands, using OUT/IN directly to the I/O ports.
